A demo for a draggable UI solution in Blazor, complete with Flux State on the front end and SignalR connectivity so all joiners on the site will see updates to the state immediately.

To Run, Deploy the SignalR Backend .NET API solution first, and then spin up as many instances of the Blazor UI solution as desired. All UI instances will be synced through the backend.
